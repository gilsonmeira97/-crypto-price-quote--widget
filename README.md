# -crypto-price-quote--widget
The default code makes the request of 6 cryptocurrencies, Ada, Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum, 
to make changes, just change the request that is made within the php code snippet present in the head of the index.php file.

The project was developed to be used as a widget on wordpress pages, where the CSS style is automatically adapting to the space where it is inserted.
